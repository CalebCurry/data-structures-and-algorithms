# Hoare's Partitioning Algorithm

Partitioning causes the data of an array to be arranged based on a chosen **pivot**. This is a chosen value used to split the data.

Elements less than the pivot go to its left and elements greater go to its right.

This does not sort the data entirely, it only places any smaller elements to the left and any larger elements to the right. Partitioning doesnâ€™t care about precise sorted order of elements.

Say we start with an array `[12, 4, 6, 40, 3, 9, 10]` and `pivot = 12` (index 0). We could end up with `[9, 4, 6, 10, 3, 12, 40]`. The result is not fully sorted, but all elements less than `12` are on the left and all elements larger are on the right.

The algorithm works by setting a pivot value, often the value at index 0. We then have a `low` pointer and `high` pointer. These two pointers move towards each other. We first move `low` to the right until it finds a value greater than the pivot. We then move `high` to the left until it finds a value less than the pivot. When these values are found we swap them and continue moving `low` and `high` inward.

Eventually the `low` and `high` pointers will collide meaning we've gone through the entire array. Where these pointers collide is the splitting point between values lower than the pivot and values higher than the pivot.

After the pointers collide we swap the pivot (`data[left]`) with the `high` pointer (`data[high]`) placing the pivot between the lesser values and greater values.

```python
def partition(data, left=0, right=None):
    if right is None:
        right = len(data) - 1

    if len(data) <= 1:
        return 0

    pivot = data[left]

    low = left + 1
    high = right

    while True:
        while low <= high and data[low] < pivot:
            low += 1

        while high >= low and data[high] > pivot:
            high -= 1


        if low >= high:
            # Move pivot to correct position
            data[left], data[high] = data[high], data[left]
            return high

        data[low], data[high] = data[high], data[low]

        # move both pointers after swap
        low += 1
        high -= 1


data = [12, 4, 6, 40, 3, 9, 10]
partition(data)
print(data) # [9, 4, 6, 10, 3, 12, 40]
```

I made it so that we use `left` and `right` passed in instead of always using the ends of the full array. This makes the function useful for algorithms where we are not always looking at the full array.

## Quick Select

We can utilize partitioning to partially sort an array and find the kth smallest or largest element, where we provide the value for `k`.  
For example, the 3rd smallest element in `[12, 4, 6, 40, 3, 9, 10]` is `6`.

```python

import random
def quick_select(data, kth):
    start = 0
    end = len(data) - 1
    #adjust to zero based
    k_index = kth - 1

    while start <= end:
        #randint is inclusive
        r = random.randint(start, end)
        data[start], data[r] = data[r], data[start]
        pivot = partition(data, start, end)

        if pivot == k_index:
            return pivot

        if pivot < k_index:
            start = pivot + 1
        else:
            end = pivot - 1

data = [12, 4, 6, 40, 3, 9, 10]
index = quick_select(data, 3)
print(index, data[index]) #2 6
```

This tells us that the 3rd smallest element in this array is `6` without having to sort the complete array.

To convert this example to the kth largest element we can change `k_index = kth - 1` to `k_index = len(data) - kth`. For example, say we pass in `k=3`, instead of finding the element that should be at index `2` in a sorted array, we will find the element that will be 2 positions from the last position of the sorted array.
